# Dual-Router NoC System in FPGA Design

This repository contains the design and implementation of a Network-on-Chip (NoC) system with two routers, developed using both VHDL and Verilog.

## Overview

The NoC system incorporates two routers, enhancing the network's flexibility and routing capabilities in FPGA environments. We utilized Intel's Quartus-II for FPGA design and Modelsim for simulation and validation purposes.

## Features

- **Languages Used**: VHDL
- **Primary Components**: Two routers for enhanced network routing
- **Design Software**: Quartus-II from Intel
- **Simulation Tool**: Modelsim

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Quartus-II](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/download.html) from Intel.
2. Install [Modelsim](https://www.mentor.com/company/higher_ed/modelsim-student-edition).
